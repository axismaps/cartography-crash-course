# cartography-crash-course

Building slides for OpenVis workshop here.

Like my initial "At a glance" slide says, I'm thinking of four main components:

1. Core cartography concepts
2. Geographic data
3. Static (print) map workflows
4. Interactive (web) map workflows

Obviously that's a lot, but like I've said before I'm picturing this as way to expose people to various important tools, etc. while getting their hands just a little bit dirty, but not really teaching "how to map with QGIS" or anything specific like that. Rather, I want to show what a lot of this stuff looks like, and load the slides up with lots of links to good resources for further learning. In the end I think this kind of "crash course" can itself be a pretty good resource to share around.

We have 3 hours... maybe cover #1 and #2 in one hour, then one hour apiece for static and web maps? And/or poll the room to see where to spend the most time.
