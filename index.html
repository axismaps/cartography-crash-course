## Overview

This is a cartographic crash course. Mastery of mapping takes a lot of learning—and a lot more than a few hours!

Today's goal is to provide a hands-on introduction to some common mapping concepts, data, and technologies, and to provide resources for further learning.

Many of these slides contain information that we won't spend much time on today. We're going to introduce some topics only briefly, leaving the slides as future reference.

---
class: bigger, middle

## At a glance

1. Core cartography concepts

2. Geographic data

4. Static (print) map workflows

4. Interactive (web) map workflows

# What is a map?

Sounds like a silly question, but it's important to understand  
the **what** and **why** of maps.

---
class: bigger

## Textbook definition

.caption[(okay, wtf, none of my actual textbooks seem to give a definition)]

A map is a *representation* of a place.

It is some human's interpretation of the place. It reflects choices and biases of the mapmaker.
It does not and cannot represent _everything_ in the place. Things must be omitted, simplified, etc. for the map to make any sense.

---
class: bigger

## Types of maps

**Reference maps** emphasize the **location** of spatial phenomena, e.g. topographic maps or road maps.

**Thematic maps** emphasize the **spatial pattern** of geographic attributes, e.g. population density or income.

When making a thematic map in particular, it's important the understand the nature of the geographic phenomena being mapped.

---

## Geographic phenomena

**Discrete phenomena** occur at distinct locations, e.g. indivudal people.  
**Continuous phenomena** occur all over a region, e.g. elevation.

**Abrupt phenomena** change suddenly, e.g. electoral votes per state.  
**Continuous phenomena** change gradually, e.g. temperature

![](images/abrupt_discrete.jpg)  
.caption[Alan MacEachren]

---

## Levels of measurement

Data produced from geographic phenomena may be **qualitative** (no numerical values) or **quantitative** (numerical values), or more specifically, one of four **levels of measurement**.

**Nominal:** categorical and non-ordered, e.g. official languages

**Ordinal:** ordered, but non-numerical, e.g. "Low", "Medium", and "High"

**Interval:** ordered, with understood numerical differences, but an arbitrary zero point, e.g. Farhenheit or Celsius temperature scales

**Ratio:** full-on numerical, with a non-arbitrary zero, e.g. population. (Ratio is the most common numerical data type.)

# Common types of thematic maps

(explain these briefly)

---
background-image: url(images/choropleth.png)
class: center, middle, white

# Choropleth

---

A **choropleth map** is a map in which **areas** are shaded by **color** to represent values. Choropleth maps are perhaps the most common and familiar type of thematic map, frequently seen for demographic or political data.

.float-right[![choropleth map](images/choropleth_example.jpg)]

- Good for data (ideally _abrupt_) aggregated to areal units such as states.

- Colors might be classed into discrete bins of data value ranges (more on that soon!) or unclassed and continuous.

- Rule #1: choropleth maps should not be used with projections that badly distort area.

- Rule #2: data values should be normalized, not simple counts. For example, _population per square mile_ is appropriate, while just _population_ is not.

More guidelines for choropleth maps: http://www.axismaps.com/guide/choropleth/

---

background-image: url(images/prop_symbol.jpg)
class: center, middle, white

# Proportional Symbols

---

On a **proportional symbol map**, symbols (such a circles) are scaled in proportion to the data they represent. Symbols might represent point data, but it is also common for proportional symbols to be used for area features.

.float-right[![proportional symbol map](images/prop_example.jpg)]

- These can be a good way around limitations of choropleth maps: they do not require an equal-area projection, and they do not require normalized data.

- Instead of sizes being directly proportional to value, sometimes symbols are **range-graded** (or **graduated**) in which case data values are binned into several discrete symbol sizes.

- Symbols should be correctly scaled by _area_, not radius. For example, if a circle is to be twice as big as another circle, its radius should be √2 larger as the other circle's, not twice as large. (Sometimes an additional perceptual scaling factor is applied to compensate for human weakness in estimating sizes.)

- Choose symbol size and map size carefully, or else proportional symbols can easily overwhelm a map.

More guidelines on proportional symbols: http://www.axismaps.com/guide/proportional_symbols/

# Dot density

---

**Dot density maps** use points to represent counts of a geographic phenomenon. 

do dot maps of actual point locations fall under this, too? or is that more of a reference map?

---
class: center, middle, white
background-image: url(images/contour.jpg)

# Contours

---

**Contour** or **isarithmic** maps interpolate values between points

- you may be less likely to make one of these, but they're seen commonly enough

(not sure if this map type is really worth including here. included it initially just because it's listed as one of the main map types in the Slocum text)

---

(other common types?)

# Map design

---

## Map medium etc.

Static map: an image, either in print or on the web

Interactive map: usually web-based, on a computer, phone, etc.

… and things like size, environment in which map will be used

---

## When to map

Just because data *can* be mapped doesn't mean it *should* be mapped. Think about whether geography is important to your story. If not, consider other ways to visualize it, or simply provide a table.

http://www.ericson.net/content/2011/10/when-maps-shouldnt-be-maps/

## Visual variables

.float-right[![visual variables](images/visvars01.jpg)]
.float-right[.caption[[image source](http://go.owu.edu/~jbkrygie/krygier_html/geog_353/geog_353_lo/geog_353_lo08.html)]]

"The differences in map elements as perceived by the human eye" ([wiki.gis.com](http://wiki.gis.com/wiki/index.php/Visual_Variables)). No matter what the type of map, these are the fundamental ways in which visual symbols can be distinguished. 

[Jacques Bertin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Bertin) proposed an original set in _Semiology of Graphics_ (1967):

- Position
- Size
- Shape
- Value (lightness)
- Color (hue)
- Orientation
- Texture

The list has been further expanded by other researches since.



---

## Color

Color is one of the more challenging design elements to perfect. It takes experience and a designer's eye to produce pleasing and effective color schemes, but there are also some guidlines to follow.

- Bear in mind certain cartographic conventions, such as blue for water and green for natural areas.
- Avoid red-green color schemes, as a significant population is colorblind and won't perceive these well.
- Keep an eye on how your color choices affect **figure-ground**, the appearance of things being in the foreground or background.
- .float-right[![color schemes](images/colorschemes.jpg)] For choropleth maps, use color ramps appropriate to the data. Is it **sequential** (ordered from low to high, e.g. population density), **diverging** (values above or below some break point, e.g. population change), or **qualitative** (having no natural order, e.g. race/ethnicity)?

More on color: http://www.axismaps.com/guide/color_schemes/, http://colorbrewer.org (click the "i" icons in each section)

---

## Data classification

Most choropleth maps (and some other types) divide data into a handful of bins (ideally 3–7). There are several [common classification schemes](http://wiki.gis.com/wiki/index.php/Classification) for dividing up data different ways—and they have a great impact on the map. The same data can result in radically different maps, depending on the classification scheme.

# Geographic data

---

Here we'll focus on some common types and sources of geographic data. Fair warning, though: geographic data can be a mess. Getting your data into a mappable format is often half the job, if not more.

---

## Basics of geographic data

Most geographic data is one of two types:

- **Vector:** shapes (or _features_) defined by geometry. Points, lines, and areas.
- **Raster:** image data, defined by pixels, for example an elevation surface

(vector vs raster image would be good here)

And comprises two components

- **Location:** e.g., latitude and longitude, and/or vector geometry
- **Attributes:** information or numerical data about the feature

---
class: center, middle

# Data formats

---

Geographic data come in a lot of flavors. Some common formats include:

- Tabular, e.g. a CSV table of points
- Shapefile: the longtime standard, actually a collection of files. Clunky but still prevalent.
- GeoJSON: common for web maps. Easily consumed by javascript code.
- Databases: e.g., PostGIS

https://4326.us/maptime-data-formats/#/

---

## Let’s look at some data files

---

## Let’s look at some data files

.bigger[[CSV](data/csv-example.txt)]

---

## Geocoding

With point data, if you're lucky it will have latitude and longitude information. Sometimes you only have addresses, though. Turning those addresses into lat/lon points requires a process called geocoding. (find some links to good geocoding services here)

---

# Data sources

---

## OpenStreetMap

Open, free, editable map of the world. The standard street map data source in the open source world.

(show short demo)

(data download links)

note: use of OSM data requires attribution!

---

## Natural Earth

Free basemap cartographic reference data

http://www.naturalearthdata.com/

(show site/examples)

---

## Government data

Census

Look for state and local GIS sites

---

google search tips when looking for specific data?

(additional data source links)

---

## Let’s get some data!

(Grab some NE base data, OSM roads, and something thematic)

---

## Working with data

---

Typical things we might want to do with data before the final map:

Clean it up

Calculate values (e.g. pop density)

Categorize, filter, etc.

Spatial operations (geoprocessing)

---

## Tools for working with data

Spreadsheets

Text editors (the power of find &amp; replace, and regex!)

Database tools and commands

GIS (we’ll get to this in a moment)

(links to some tools)

---

## Converting between data formats

Often needs to happen when preparing data for a web map.

Can use QGIS (demo coming up), or tools like mapshaper etc.

---

# Let’s make a map!

---

# A basic map workflow

1. Acquire data
2. Clean and edit data as necessary
3. Import data to GIS
4. Further geodata processing if needed
5. Symbolize data and lay out map including other elements
6. Export map to image, or vector format for further design work

---

# GIS

Geographic Information System

Wikipedia: “a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present all types of spatial or geographical data.”

A lot of tools, sets of tools, or operations can fall under this umbrella; however “GIS” often refers to a single piece of software.

---

# GIS

ArcGIS by Esri has long reigned supreme as *the* GIS software. It’s powerful, and everywhere… but also expensive.

---

# GIS

QGIS is the open-source GIS software of choice. It’s growing more awesome every day and has an excellent community of users. This is what we’ll use to make a map today.

---

# Let’s do it!

We only have time for a brief look at a few of the features of QGIS. For a more in-depth guide, Mike’s tutorial http://maptimeboston.github.io/qgis-101/#0 (plus other resources)

---

(just demo things in the following sections; make slides for future reference)
TBD: what data to use &amp; what map to make!
Ideally combine different data sources and/or types

---

There's a lot going on in QGIS. But most of the time, for basic mapping, you'll likely only use a handful of core tools.

![QGIS UI](images/qgis_tools.png)

---

# Layers

Most maps in GIS are organized in terms of **layers**. Each layer represents a geographic data set (e.g., country outlines or city points), or some kind of annotation.

[image of layers]

---

# Importing data

For many formats, just open it

CSV joins

---

# Map properties

Projection

Background color

---

# Attributes

Attribute table

Field calculator

Identify tool

Selecting by attributes

---

# Symbolizing data

Colors, sizes

Choose styles layer-wide, or based on attributes

http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/basic_vector_styling.html

---

# Editing data

Geometry, attributes

Sadly QGIS can only edit geometry of shapefiles

---

# Geoprocessing

Advanced calculations, transformations of geometry, etc.

---

# Map layout and export

Print composer, ugh

Really nice maps can be made with QGIS alone, but most professional cartos will refine further in a graphics program, e.g. Inkscape

---

# Recap

# Also

List some other ways to make static maps

---

# Web maps


---

# What is a web map?

We don’t mean simply a map on the web (which could include static images), but maps more powered by the web: interactive, code-driven, live data, animated, etc. etc.
It could be a reference map like Google, or a data-driven map (NYT etc.), or anything in between

https://github.com/maptimeBoston/web-maps-101

---

# When should a map be interactive?

The web makes it tempting to go bananas and throw everything into a map, with all kinds of interaction and data and everything. Design carefully for your purpose. The map still needs to look good, and have a good user experience. Especially bear this in mind if your users are only going to spend 15 seconds looking at the thing.

---

# Web map design considerations

Most of the static map rules apply

mobile!

...and some other stuff

(list)

---

# Web map technology

Web mapping is a quickly evolving arena, technically. Your options will seem more diverse than the static GIS world, and often come with a steeper learning curve. But several companies do focus on products and services aimed at lowering the barrier of entry.

---

# Web mapping products/services

(list some, Mapbox etc.)

---

# Building your own web map

Those companies are happy to show you how to use their products. Today we’re going to show a more DIY approach in order to introduce some of the fundamental technology of web maps.

---

# Web map architecture

Most web maps will have at least two things: data and code. Sometimes that’s it, e.g. many NYT interactives.
Often, a third component: a basemap (define basemap here). Sometimes that basemap IS the only data, and sometimes there is data on top of it.

---

# Slippy map

A map that can be panned and zoomed (like Google Maps) is sometimes called a “slippy map” in the lingo. Most slippy maps are:

1. In the mercator projection
2. Tiled (either as images or vector data)
3. (there’s gotta be something else!)

See Anatomy of a Web Map etc.

---

# Building a custom slippy map

Leaflet is the most popular open-source javascript library. It is lightweight and easy to use, supporting basic map interactions, tiled map layers, and vector data layers (such as geojson data). It’s a good place to start a journey of custom web mapping.

(Demo a simple Leaflet map)

http://maptimeboston.github.io/leaflet-intro/

---

# Let’s make a web map!

(breeze over a lot of this as needed. There just isn’t time to teach every detail)

This will be a simplified demo that provides a taste of a web mapping workflow. As always, it takes a lot of learning and work to really master web maps. Learning to code is of course a big part of that, if you’re not already a coder.
Fortunately, there are tons of resources and an amazing open mapping community to assist you in learning this stuff. (Many links to be provided shortly)

[Need some non-headache way to get people running local servers, or maybe there is some online sandbox?]

---

# Beginning at the end

Just want to show how simple a basic web map looks from a technical standpoint. It’s not intimidating.
(Show end product of whatever we’re making here, and the code which won’t be too long)

---

# Anatomy of *this* web map:

- Our data
- A basemap
- html/js code

---

# Basic setup

Html page

Import leaflet libraries

---

# We need a basemap!

Unlike a static map, where the extent of your base data is limited, on a web map it usually covers many scales and often vast areas. This means a LOT of data and design decisions. (For example see how you get more detail as you zoom into Google, and the designs change.) Therefore a making a basemap on your own can be a huge task. We’ll point out some resources and services for doing just that, but very often you’ll be using a pre-made (whether by you or by someone else) basemap.

---

# Choosing a basemap

Show some sources. Leaflet providers demo thing.

You can’t (legally) just pull in Google’s map, etc. Go with OSM-based maps.

---

# Loading basemap into Leaflet

Boom, just like that we have a map.

Set initial location, zoom, etc.

---

# Data

Cool, now we want our own data.

Whatever it is, start with a shapefile or something so we can show conversion to geojson

---

# Loading data to leaflet

L.geojson

Open web inspector maybe? Show the html/svg structure of the map

---

# Customizing &amp; getting more advanced

Styling (do a choropleth or proportional symbol or something)
Interaction (hovers, popups)

---

# And beyond…

With more coding, you can do awesome things.

(list of more leaflet and/or map-ish js resources. in-depth stuff like DUSPviz)

---

# Additional options for web maps

D3

Mapbox

CartoDB (good place to start for out-of-the-box maps of your data)

Esri?
